## Changes Implemented

### ✅ Change 3: Add Error Recovery Sections (P2 - Medium)

**Problem**: Assignment instructions don't provide guidance on handling errors, leading to inconsistent error handling and wasted debugging time.

**Solution**: Created comprehensive error recovery template.

**Features**:
- **Common Errors** (7 categories):
  - Dependency installation failures
  - Build failures
  - Type checking failures
  - Linter/formatter failures
  - Test failures
  - Container build failures
  - CI/CD pipeline failures
- **For Each Error**:
  - Symptoms (what you see)
  - Possible causes (why it happens)
  - Solutions (how to fix it)
- **Escalation Procedure** (4 steps):
  - Document the error
  - Create an issue
  - Notify user
  - Do not proceed
- **Rollback Procedure** (4 steps):
  - Assess impact
  - Perform rollback
  - Verify rollback
  - Document rollback
- **Prevention Tips**:
  - Before starting
  - During execution
  - After completion

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Provides clear guidance for common errors
- ✅ Reduces time spent debugging
- ✅ Ensures consistent error handling
- ✅ Prevents agents from proceeding with errors
- ✅ Includes specific solutions for each error type

### ✅ Change 6: Enhance Debrief Template (P2 - Medium)

**Problem**: Debriefing reports lack consistent structure, making them harder to compare and analyze.

2. **Workflow Overview** - Table with all assignments, duration, complexity
3. **Key Deliverables** - Checklist of all deliverables
4. **Lessons Learned** - Numbered list of key learnings
5. **What Worked Well** - With explanations
6. **What Could Be Improved** - With issues, impact, and suggestions
7. **Errors Encountered and Resolutions** - Detailed format for each error
8. **Complex Steps and Challenges** - Structured format for challenges
9. **Suggested Changes** - By category (workflow, agent, prompt, script)
10. **Metrics and Statistics** - Quantitative data
11. **Future Recommendations** - By timeframe (short, medium, long term)
12. **Conclusion** - Assessment, rating, final recommendations, next steps

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Ensures consistent report structure

  - Checkpoint 1: 25% complete
  - Checkpoint 2: 50% complete
  - Checkpoint 3: 75% complete
  - Final Checkpoint: 100% complete
- **For Each Checkpoint**:
  - Task list
  - Report format
  - Example report
