## 📝 Migration Guide

### Updating Existing Workflows

**Before**:
```markdown
$assignments` = [
    `create-project-structure`,
    `debrief-and-document`
]
```

**After**:
```markdown
$assignments` = [
    `create-application-foundation`,
    `create-application-structure`,
    `create-testing-infrastructure`,
    `create-deployment-infrastructure`,
    `debrief-and-document`
]
```

### Adding Validation

Add to workflow's Events section:

```markdown
### Events

#### `post-assignment-complete`

`$validation_assignments` = [`validate-assignment-completion`]

For each `$assignment_name` in `$validation_assignments`, you will:
   - assign the agent the `$assignment_name` assignment
   - wait until the agent finishes the task
   - review the validation results
   - if validation failed, halt workflow and request manual intervention
   - if validation passed, record output as `#events.post-assignment-complete.$assignment_name`
```
