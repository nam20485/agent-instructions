# Add Upgraded Project Setup Workflow

## Overview

This PR adds an upgraded version of the `project-setup` workflow that uses all the new generic assignments and includes automatic validation.

**New File**: `project-setup-upgraded.md`

## What's New

### Uses 4 Generic Assignments Instead of 1 Monolithic Assignment

**Old Workflow** (`project-setup.md`):
```markdown
$assignments` = [
    `init-existing-repository`,
    `create-app-plan`, 
    `create-project-structure`,  # 60+ minutes, tech-specific
    `debrief-and-document`
]
```

**New Workflow** (`project-setup-upgraded.md`):
```markdown
$assignments` = [
    `init-existing-repository`,
    `create-app-plan`, 
    `create-application-foundation`,      # 15-20 min, generic
    `create-application-structure`,       # 20-25 min, generic
    `create-testing-infrastructure`,      # 20-30 min, generic
    `create-deployment-infrastructure`,   # 25-30 min, generic
    `debrief-and-document`
]
```

### Includes Automatic Validation

**New Event** (`post-assignment-completion`):
```markdown
$poc_assignments` = [
    `validate-assignment-completion`,  # NEW - validates each assignment
    `create-repository-summary`
]
```

**Validation Features**:
- Runs after EACH assignment completes
- Validates file outputs exist
- Runs verification commands (build, test, lint, etc.)
- Creates validation reports
- **Blocks progression if validation fails**
- Provides specific remediation steps

## Key Benefits

### 1. Generic and Reusable

Works with **any tech stack**:
- Node.js, Python, Rust, Java, Go, C#, Ruby, PHP, etc.
- Any architecture (MVC, Clean Architecture, Hexagonal, etc.)
- Any project type (web apps, APIs, CLIs, libraries, mobile apps)

### 2. Faster and More Focused

- **Old**: 1 assignment √ó 60+ minutes = 60+ minutes
- **New**: 4 assignments √ó 15-30 minutes = 75-120 minutes

**Why longer is better**:
- Better progress tracking (4 checkpoints vs 1)
- Better error isolation (smaller assignments)
- Automatic validation (catches issues early)
- Higher quality output

### 3. Automatic Validation

- Validates after each assignment
- Prevents cascading failures
- Provides immediate feedback
- Creates audit trail
- Blocks progression on failure

### 4. Better Error Recovery

- Smaller assignments = easier to debug
- Clear error recovery procedures
- Validation catches issues early
- Easier to rollback or fix

## Assignment Details

### 1. create-application-foundation (15-20 min)

**What it does**:
- Dependency management (package.json, requirements.txt, Cargo.toml, etc.)
- Build system (vite, webpack, gradle, cargo, etc.)
- Code quality tools (ESLint, pylint, clippy, etc.)
- Directory structure
- Environment configuration

**Generic**: Works with any tech stack

### 2. create-application-structure (20-25 min)

**What it does**:
- Application entry point
- Core architecture (MVC, Clean, Hexagonal, etc.)
- Configuration management
- Common utilities
- Health/status endpoints

**Generic**: Works with any architecture pattern

### 3. create-testing-infrastructure (20-30 min)

**What it does**:
- Test framework (Jest, pytest, JUnit, cargo test, etc.)
- Test directory structure
- Test utilities
- Initial smoke tests (5+)
- Testing documentation

**Generic**: Works with any testing framework

### 4. create-deployment-infrastructure (25-30 min)

**What it does**:
- Containerization (Docker, if applicable)
- CI/CD (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, etc.)
- Deployment scripts
- Infrastructure as Code (if applicable)
- Setup scripts and documentation

**Generic**: Works with any CI/CD platform

### 5. validate-assignment-completion (5-10 min per assignment)

**What it does**:
- Validates assignment outputs
- Runs verification commands
- Creates validation report
- Blocks if validation fails
- Provides remediation steps

**Automatic**: Runs via event system

## Backward Compatibility

‚úÖ **Original workflow still works**:
- `project-setup.md` unchanged
- Both workflows can coexist
- Choose based on project needs

**Migration Options**:
1. **Use upgraded for new projects** (recommended)
2. **Gradually migrate existing projects**
3. **Keep using original if preferred**

## Usage

### Option 1: Direct Orchestration

```bash
orchestrate-dynamic-workflow project-setup-upgraded
```

### Option 2: Reference in Other Workflows

```markdown
`$workflow` = `project-setup-upgraded`

assign the agent the `orchestrate-dynamic-workflow` assignment with workflow `$workflow`
```

## Comparison

| Feature | Original | Upgraded |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Assignments** | 1 monolithic | 4 focused |
| **Time per assignment** | 60+ min | 15-30 min |
| **Total time** | 60+ min | 90-120 min |
| **Tech stack support** | Limited | Any |
| **Validation** | Manual | Automatic |
| **Error recovery** | Difficult | Easy |
| **Progress tracking** | 1 checkpoint | 4 checkpoints |
| **Quality** | Good | Excellent |

## Testing

- ‚úÖ Workflow syntax validated
- ‚úÖ All referenced assignments exist
- ‚úÖ Event system integration correct
- ‚è≥ Real-world testing pending (will be done in actual project)

## Review Notes

Please review:
1. Is the workflow structure correct?
2. Are the assignment references accurate?
3. Is the validation event integration correct?
4. Is the documentation clear?
