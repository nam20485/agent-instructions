#Plan for optimizing agent-instructions files for size

## Goals

1. Reduce size and complexity of agent instructions files and structure to reduce size significantly
2. Models using it have to load way too much into context which is context rot
3. Produce methods to improve use and effecxtiveness of remaining instructions left after size reduction

## Steps

0. Research proven methods to reduce custom instructions size to improve efficiency for context and reduce context rot, and utilkize remining instructions more effectively
1. Analyze all files
2. Brainstorm methods to reduce size and complexity and methofd to reduce context rot
3. DOcument all strategies
   a. Analyze each strategy for cost and complixity vs. oprimzaiotn gains
   b. Organizee into tiers

## Output
Document listing and describing all strategies, dicussing feasinilitym, and rating them
