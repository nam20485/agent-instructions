I'm currently reviewing this pull request and will post my feedback shortly. In the meantime, here's a summary to help you and other reviewers quickly get up to speed!\n\nI've undertaken a complete refactor of the custom instructions for AI agents within this repository. This initiative aims to establish a more modular, structured, and comprehensive guidance system. The changes enhance clarity and streamline various development workflows by providing explicit instructions on AI persona, core behaviors, and detailed task assignments. This refactor moves away from monolithic instruction files towards a more organized and maintainable system, ultimately improving the efficiency and consistency of AI-assisted development.\n\n### Highlights\n\n* **Modular Instruction System**: I've introduced a new `ai_instruction_modules` directory containing a suite of specialized markdown files. This modularity allows for more organized and granular control over AI instructions, making them easier to manage and extend.\n* **Core Instruction Definition**: I've added `ai-core-instructions.md` to centralize the AI's persona, scope, conflict resolution hierarchy, core behaviors, constraints, and change flow. This file provides a foundational guide for all AI interactions, ensuring consistent and predictable responses.\n* **Specialized Workflow Assignments**: I've introduced several new workflow assignment modules (e.g., `analyze-progress-doc.md`, `breakdown-issue.md`, `create-app-plan.md`, `create-project-structure.md`). These modules provide detailed, step-by-step instructions for specific development tasks, streamlining complex workflows for AI agents.\n* **Updated Copilot Instructions**: The main `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file has been drastically simplified. It now serves as a high-level pointer to the new modular instruction system, improving maintainability and reducing redundancy by centralizing detailed instructions in the `ai_instruction_modules` directory.\n* **Dev Container Cache Update**: I've modified the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file to update the `cacheFrom` Docker image reference. This ensures that the development container uses the correct and most up-to-date image for caching, improving build times and consistency.\n* **Feedback Documentation**: I've added detailed feedback documents (`docs/feedback-custom-instructions-copilot-gemini.md`, `docs/feedback-on-ai-instructions modules.md`, `docs/feedback-on-ai-instructions.md`) that analyze the instruction framework, suggest improvements, and provide concrete examples. These documents are crucial for iterating on and refining the AI's guidance system.\n* **VS Code Task Integration**: I've added `tasks.json` to provide convenient VS Code tasks. These tasks allow users to quickly open relevant AI instruction files based on the context of their current coding activity (e.g., general coding, testing, new application), enhancing developer workflow efficiency.\n\n\n\n\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Using Gemini Code Assist</b></summary>\n<br>\n\nThe full guide for Gemini Code Assist can be found on our [documentation page](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/review-github-code), here are some quick tips.\n\n<b>Invoking Gemini</b>\n\nYou can request assistance from Gemini at any point in your pull request via creating an issue comment (i.e. comment on the pull request page) using either `/gemini <command>` or `@gemini-code-assist <command>`.
