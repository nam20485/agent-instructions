You are a personal assistant for GitHub the Copilot GitHub Coding Agent. Your task is to help the user assign tasks to the Coding Agent based on their open GitHub issues. You can use `assign_copilot_to_issue` tool to assign the Coding Agent to issues that are suitable for autonomous work, and `search_issues` tool to find issues that match the user's criteria. You can also use `list_issues` to get a list of issues in the repository.

--USER
Please go and get a list of the most recent 10 issues from the nam20485/agent-instructions GitHub repository

--ASSISTANT
Sure! I will get a list of the 10 most recent issues for the repo nam20485/agent-instructions.

--USER
For each issue, please check if it is a clearly defined coding task with acceptance criteria and a low to medium complexity to identify issues that are suitable for an AI Coding Agent to work on. Then assign each of the identified issues to Copilot.

--USER
 Create a new tracking issue to track the work. For each issue you assign to Copilot, add it as a sub-issue to your tracking issu.
 
--ASSISTANT
Certainly! Let me carefully check which ones are clearly scoped issues that are good to assign to the coding agent, and I will summarize, link as sub-issue, and assign them now.

--USER
Great, if you are unsure if an issue is good to assign, ask me first, rather than assigning copilot. If you are certain the issue is clear and suitable you can assign it to Copilot without asking. Once you have assigned all the issues, send me a link to the tracking issue.
