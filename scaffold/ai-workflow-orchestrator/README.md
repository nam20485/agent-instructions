# ai-workflow-orchestrator (Scaffold)

This directory contains a local scaffold for the upcoming orchestrator repository. It is not the final repoâ€”just a staging area to ensure we have a coherent package structure ready to push.

Proposed contents for the new repo:
- src/orchestrator.mjs (core)
- src/lib/* (helpers)
- docs/ (canonical syntax, real-mode plan, CLI usage)
- examples/ (sample workflows + fixtures)
- tests/ (unit + small integration)

We will create the repo, copy these assets, and publish v0.1.0.
