# ai-workflow-orchestrator (Scaffold)

This directory contains a local scaffold for the upcoming orchestrator repository. It is not the final repoâ€”just a staging area to ensure we have a coherent package structure ready to push.

Proposed contents for the new repo:
- src/orchestrator.mjs (core)
- src/lib/* (helpers)
- docs/ (canonical syntax, real-mode plan, CLI usage)
- examples/ (sample workflows + fixtures)
- tests/ (unit + small integration)

We will create the repo, copy these assets, and publish v0.1.0.

## AI Workflow Orchestrator (Scaffold)

This is a temporary scaffold for extracting the orchestrator into its own repository.

- CLI bin: `ai-orchestrator`
- Source: `src/cli.mjs`
- Default conventions:
	- Workflows directory: `./workflows` (override with `--workflows-path`)
	- Executors directory: `./executors` (override with `--exec-paths`)

## Try it locally (from repo root)

You can run the CLI from its bin with Node without publishing:

```sh
node ./scaffold/ai-workflow-orchestrator/bin/orchestrator.mjs \
	--workflow sample-minimal \
	--workflows-path ai_instruction_modules/ai-workflow-assignments/dynamic-workflows \
	--exec-paths scripts/executors \
	--console \
	--log logs/sample-minimal-exec-scaffold.jsonl
```

Or dry-run planning only:

```sh
node ./scaffold/ai-workflow-orchestrator/bin/orchestrator.mjs \
	--dry-run \
	--workflow sample-minimal \
	--workflows-path ai_instruction_modules/ai-workflow-assignments/dynamic-workflows \
	--console \
	--log logs/sample-minimal-dry-scaffold.jsonl
```

When the new repo is created, these files will move there and this folder will be removed in favor of a dependency.
