● I'll help you set up the project and create the app using the dynamic workflow orchestration system. Let me start
by reading the necessary instruction files and then execute the workflow.

● Let me first check what shell we're using and then fetch the required instruction files:

● Bash(echo $SHELL)
  ⎿  /usr/bin/bash

● Read(file_path: "E:\src\github\nam20485\dynamic_workflows\advanced-memory-tango32\local_ai_instruction_modules\ai-dyna
      mic-workflows.md")
  ⎿  Read 92 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Read(file_path: "E:\src\github\nam20485\dynamic_workflows\advanced-memory-tango32\local_ai_instruction_modules\ai-work
      flow-assignments.md")
  ⎿  Read 196 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● I can see the workflow files are indexed, but I notice the requested workflow name "setup-project-and-create-app"
  doesn't appear in the index. However, I can see related workflows like "project-setup". Let me fetch the
orchestrate-dynamic-workflow assignment to understand how to properly execute this:

● Bash(curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nam20485/agent-instructions/main/ai_instruction_modules/ai-workflow-as

⎿ # Assignment: Orchestrate Dynamic Workflow

## (orchestrate-dynamic-workflow)

## Overview
The dynamic workflow orchestration assignment is different than static workflow assignments, in that it must
orchestrate workflows for a dynamically specified list of workflow assignments, as specified in a dynamic
workflow file. The dynamic workflow file specifies assignments to be performed in the "Script" section of the
file.

## Inputs
- $workflow_name: the dynamic workflow name to execute (string)

## Goal
Orchestrate systematically through the assignments as specified in the provided dynamic workflow file's Script
    section, performing the steps in each one to completion in turn. Assignments are specified by short ID.

    ### Assignment

    Your assignment is to orchestrate the workflow assignment as specified by name and instructions in the provided
     dynamic workflow file. This involves systematically iterating through each specified assignment, orchestrating
     and overseeing the work until completion, according to the instructions specified in the "Script" section in
    the dynamic workflow file.

    #### Dynamic Workflow File Conventions

    - The workflow name provided indicates a dynamic workflow file located in the
    [./ai_instruction_modules/ai-workflow-assignments/dynamic-workflows](./dynamic-workflows) directory.
    - The format for naming the dynamic workflow files may be standardized; see repository conventions.

    > Example: Specifying "new-project" as input, when invoking the orchestrate-dynamic-workflow assignment, will
    look for a dynamic workflow file at
    `./ai_instruction_modules/ai-workflow-assignments/dynamic-workflows/new-project.md`.

    - Ensure the file contains a "## Script" section with one or more third-level step headings (e.g., "###
    create-project-and-plan").
    - Run the orchestrate-dynamic-workflow assignment with input `<name>`.

    ### Scripts section

    The detailed steps are specified in the "Script" section of the dynamic workflow file. Essentially, you will
    iterate through each assignment specified in the file, orchestrating and overseeing the work until completion,
    according to the instructions provided in the "Script" section of the dynamic workflow file.

    #### Scripts / Inputs Section

    This section lists the input variables provided by the calling process or invocation. It will be passed in by
    the calling invoker and then should be provided as-is to the invoked workflow assignment.

    ## Acceptance Criteria
    1. All specified assignments are completed and approved.
    2. All specified assignments are completed in the order specified in the dynamic workflow file.
    3. All specified assignments are completed according to the instructions in the dynamic workflow file.
    4. All acceptance criteria for each specified assignment are met.
    5. All directives in the Script section of the dynamic workflow file are executed.
    6. Approval is obtained for the final product.
    7. No unresolved items remain at completion; results are documented and cross-linked as appropriate.

    ## Guardrails (Authoritative, Non-Optional)
    These apply to all dynamic workflows.

    - Resolution trace (mandatory before execution)
      - Resolve and print the dereference chain with URLs (and SHAs when available):
        orchestrate-dynamic-workflow → dynamic-workflows/$workflow_name → [assignments] →
    ai-workflow-assignments/<assignment>.md
      - Refuse to proceed if any file in the chain is unreadable.

    - Assignment-first execution (no step synthesis)
      - Dynamic workflow files may enumerate assignment names and inputs only.
      - Execute steps strictly from the resolved assignment file(s). Do not infer or invent steps from the dynamic
    workflow file. Do not choose items with names that are close but not exact matches.

    - Acceptance-criteria gating (Definition of Done)
      - Extract the Acceptance Criteria from each assignment file.
      - Treat each criterion as a must-pass gate. Do not declare success unless every criterion passes.
    - Template and preflight enforcement
      - If the assignment specifies template/source-of-truth requirements (e.g., create repo from a template,
    enforce license/visibility, required scripts), enforce them.
      - If the target already exists but violates preconditions, either:
        - Recreate per spec; or
      -  **IF** pre-existing artifcats strictly meet acceptance criteroa and/or instruction, leave them and record
    a non-creation event.

    - Branch protection
      - For code changes: if the default branch is protected, use a feature branch + PR path; do not force-push to
    protected branches.
      - Non-code changes (e.g., settings, metadata) can be made directly to the default branch, even if protected.

    - Run Report (mandatory)
      - Produce a final Run Report mapped 1:1 to each assignment’s Acceptance Criteria with PASS/FAIL and evidence
links.

- Run Log
- Maintain a detailed log of actions taken, decisions made, and any issues encountered during execution.
- This log should be included in the final Run Report and debriefing documentfor transparency and auditing
purposes.
- Include actions taken at dynamic workflow level (e.g., "Starting assignment X") as well as actions taken at
the individual assignment level, and all agent delegation events.

## Execution Algorithm (Deterministic & Idempotent)

1) Intake
- Capture inputs: $workflow_name.
- Resolve and print the resolution trace:
- dynamic-workflows/$workflow_name.md → list of `$assignments`
- For each: ai-workflow-assignments/<assignment>.md
- Abort early if any file is missing or unreadable.

1) Plan
- For each assignment:
- Parse Inputs, Detailed Steps, and Acceptance Criteria from the assignment file.
- Expand steps into concrete actions and checks for the current environment (permissions, branch protection,
    etc.).
- Decide direct-to-default-branch vs. feature-branch+PR route.

1) Execute (per assignment, in order)
- Perform the Detailed Steps exactly as written in the assignment file.
- Honor preflight requirements (templates, scripts, visibility, licenses) before continuing.
- If a required step cannot be executed (e.g., missing permission), stop and report—do not partially declare
success. DO NOT leave for anyone else to perform.
- Do not continue performing any later step until you have successfully finished the current step, and all
previous steps.
- Your job is to perform the steps, do not plan to have anyone else perform any steps.

1) Verify (Gated)
- Evaluate each Acceptance Criterion.
- Record PASS/FAIL with evidence (links to repos, files, PRs, issues, projects, etc.).
- If any FAIL, stop and report the unmet criteria and remediation options.

1) Report
- Produce a Run Report (schema below) including the resolution trace, actions performed, and the
acceptance-gated results.

## Preflight Checklist (Before Any Actions)
- Files readable:
- dynamic-workflows/$workflow_name.md
- All referenced ai-workflow-assignments/<assignment>.md files
- Environment:
- Required credentials/permissions available (e.g., GitHub repo create, labels, projects).
- Branch protection understood; PR route planned if needed.
- Template/source-of-truth:
- If specified by the assignment, verify template availability and policy; plan enforcement.

## Run Report (Required Schema)
- Header
- Assignment: orchestrate-dynamic-workflow
- Inputs: $workflow_name (summarized)
- Resolution Trace
- Ordered list of files used with URLs (and SHAs if available)
- Actions Executed
- For each assignment, list the key actions performed (mirroring Detailed Steps)
- Acceptance Criteria Results
- For each assignment, list each criterion with PASS/FAIL and evidence links
- Deviations
- Any variance from assignment specs (e.g., exxplicitly pre-approved deviations), with rationale and
authorizating party's name
    - Outcome
      - Success only if all Acceptance Criteria are PASS (or explicitly approved deviations)

    ## Dynamic Workflow File Conventions (Reference)
    - Dynamic workflow files reside under ai-workflow-assignments/dynamic-workflows.
    - They provide the Script section which enumerates assignment names and inputs.
    - They do not define executable steps; steps are defined in the referenced assignment files.
    - Canonical syntax reference: [dynamic-workflow-syntax.md](dynamic-workflows/dynamic-workflow-syntax.md)

    ## How to Run (Quick Start)
    1. Place your workflow file under ai-workflow-assignments/dynamic-workflows/<name>.md.
    2. Ensure the file contains a "## Script" section that enumerates assignment short IDs and inputs.
    3. Invoke this orchestrator with input: $workflow_name=<name>.
    4. The orchestrator resolves the assignment files and executes their Detailed Steps to completion (gated by
    Acceptance Criteria).
    5. Review the final Run Report; approve or request changes.

    ## Completion
    After all steps have been completed and all Acceptance Criteria have passed (or explicitly approved deviations
    are recorded), notify the user that the workflow is complete and provide the Run Report.

    ## Prompt Guidance (Embed in any chat prompt)
    Use this pre-execution preamble in any prompt that invokes this orchestrator to ensure consistent,
    acceptance-gated runs across tools and contexts.

    Before execution (must do):
    - Print the resolution trace (files + URLs/SHAs when available):
      - orchestrate-dynamic-workflow → dynamic-workflows/$workflow_name → assignments →
    ai-workflow-assignments/<assignment>.md
    - Refuse to proceed if any file in the chain is unreadable.

    Execution rules (non-negotiable):
    - Execute steps strictly from the resolved assignment file(s); do not synthesize steps from dynamic workflow
    files.
    - Extract Acceptance Criteria from each assignment and treat them as gates.
    - Enforce template/source-of-truth and required scripts/visibility/license per assignment.
    - Respect branch protection (use feature branch + PR) for code changes.
    - Non-code changes (e.g., settings, metadata) can be made directly to the default branch, even if protected..

    Completion (Definition of Done):
    - Produce a Run Report containing:
      - Resolution trace (files + URLs/SHAs)
      - Actions executed (mirroring Detailed Steps)
      - Acceptance Criteria: PASS/FAIL per item with evidence links
      - Deviations (if any) with rationale
      - Outcome: Success only if all criteria PASS (or explicitly approved deviations)

    Embeddable snippet:

    ```
    Before any execution:
    - Print the resolution trace (files + URLs/SHAs) for: orchestrate-dynamic-workflow →
    dynamic-workflows/$workflow_name → assignments → ai-workflow-assignments/<assignment>.md
    - Refuse to proceed if any file cannot be read.

    Execution rules:
    - Use only the resolved assignment file(s) for executable steps.
    - Extract Acceptance Criteria and enforce them as gates (no partial done).
    - Enforce template/scripts/visibility/license per assignment; respect branch protection (feature branch + PR)
    and idempotency.

    Completion:
    - Produce a Run Report with: resolution trace, actions executed, PASS/FAIL per criterion with evidence,
    deviations, and final outcome.
    ```

  ⎿ # Dynamic Workflow: Setup Project and Create Application

    ## Overview

    This dynamic workflow file specifies the workflow for creating a new application from an existing setup
    project. It is intended to be used with the `orchestrate-dynamic-workflow` assignment. You will use the main
    plan issue that was created in the `create-app-plan` assignment as the parent issue for this workflow.

    ## Script

    ### Inputs

     ### setup-project-and-create-app

    `$assignments` = [
                        `init-existing-repository`,
                        `create-app-plan`,
                        `create-project-structure`,
                        `create-app-from-plan-issue`,
                        `debrief-and-document`,
                     ]

    For each `$assignment_name` in `$assignments`, you will:
       - assign the agent the `$assignment_name` assignment
       - wait until the agent finishes the task
       - review the work and approve it
       - record output as `#init-existing-repository.$assignment_name`

● Perfect! I found the workflow. Now let me update the todo list and begin executing according to the orchestration
  instructions:

● ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  Dynamic Workflow Orchestration
  - This uses a two-level indirection: the workflow file lists assignments, each assignment contains detailed steps
  - Resolution trace ensures we're using the canonical source (not cached/local mirrors)
  - Acceptance criteria from each assignment act as quality gates - no partial success allowed
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

● ✓ All assignment files are readable and validated.

● Perfect! Now I'll begin executing the first assignment. Let me fetch the complete init-existing-repository
  assignment and delegate to a specialist agent:

● Bash(curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nam20485/agent-instructions/main/ai_instruction_modules/ai-workflow-as
signments/init-existing-repository.md")
  ⎿ # Assignment: Initiate Existing Repository

    ## (init-existing-repository)

    ### Goal

    Your goal is to initiate a new repository for a project. This involves creating the repository, copying the
    provided files to the repository, configuring the necessary settings, and creating the initial administrative
    structure.

    ### Inputs

    ### Acceptance Criteria

    0. PR and new branch created
    1. Git Project created for issue tracking
    2. Milestones created based on application plan phases
    3. Labels imported for issue management
    4. Filenames changed to match project name

    ### Assignment

    Your assignment is to set up an existing repository for a project. This involves configuring the necessary
    settings. You will create a new issue-tracking project, import labels, and create milestones. You will rename
    workspace and devcontainer files to match the project name.

    ### Detailed Steps

    1. **Create PR and New Branch**
       - Create a new branch named after the invoking dynamic workflow assignment which called this workflow
    assignment, with the prefix `dynamic-workflow-`.
       - For example, if the dynamic workflow assignment is `project-setup`, the branch should be named
    `dynamic-workflow-project-setup`.
       - Create a pull request (PR) for the new branch to merge into `main`
       - Changes will most likely not be made until subsequent workflow assignmments invoked after this one, so it
    will be left open until all subsequent assignments are complete and approved.
       - Later workflow assignments will commit and push changes to this branch.

    2. **Create GitHub Project for Issue Tracking**
       - Create a new GitHub Project for issue tracking
       - Name the project the same as the repository
       - Set the project to `Board` template

    3. **Import Labels**
       - Import the labels from the `.labels.json` file in the root of the repository
       - Use the `import-labels.ps1` script to import the labels

    4.  **Rename Workspace and Devcontainer Files**
       - Inside the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file rename the `name` property to use the repository name as
     the prefix, preserving the "devcontainer" suffix. Template: `<repo-name>-devcontainer`
       - Rename the `ai-new-app-template.code-workspace` file to use the repository name as the prefix, preserving
    the ".code-workspace" extension. Template: `<repo-name>.code-workspace`

    ### Completion

    After all steps have been completed, notify the orchestrator that this assignment has been completed and obtain
     approval to move to the next step. The repository has been initiated and is ready for the next step.

● ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  Assignment Delegation Pattern
  - Each assignment has specific acceptance criteria that must be validated
  - The orchestrator delegates technical work to specialist agents (per delegation mandate requiring ≥75% coverage)
  - Branch creation happens first to isolate all changes for review via PR
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Now I'll delegate this assignment to a specialist DevOps agent per the delegation mandate:

● devops-engineer(Task: Initialize existing repository (using devops-engineer agent)

                 Prompt: You are assigned the "init-existing-repository" workflow assignment. Your goal is to initiate
                 this existing repository for the project by performing the following steps:

                 2. Milestones created based on application plan phases
                 3. Labels imported for issue management
                 4. Filenames changed to match project name

                 Detailed Steps to Execute

                 1. Create PR and New Branch
                   - Create branch: dynamic-workflow-setup-project-and-create-app
                   - Create a PR for this branch to merge into main
                   - Leave PR open for subsequent assignments to commit changes
                 2. Create GitHub Project for Issue Tracking
                   - Create new GitHub Project named same as repository (advanced-memory-tango32)
                   - Use Board template
                 3. Import Labels
                   - Import labels from .labels.json file in repository root
                   - Use import-labels.ps1 script to import
                 4. Rename Workspace and Devcontainer Files
                   - Update .devcontainer/devcontainer.json name property to: advanced-memory-tango32-devcontainer
                   - Rename ai-new-app-template.code-workspace to: advanced-memory-tango32.code-workspace

                 Important Instructions

                 - You are working in: E:\src\github\nam20485\dynamic_workflows\advanced-memory-tango32
                 - Repository: advanced-memory-tango32
                 - Main branch: main
                 - Use MCP GitHub tools first, then VS Code integration, fallback to gh CLI only if needed
                 - If GitHub tools need authorization, initiate the auth flow - user will complete interactively
                 - Commit all file changes to the new branch
                 - Maintain ≥90% automation coverage for GitHub operations

                 What to Return

                 Provide a detailed report with:

  ⎿  # Assignment: Initiate Existing Repository

     ## (init-existing-repository)

     ### Goal

     Your goal is to initiate a new repository for a project. This involves creating the repository, copying the
     provided files to the repository, configuring the necessary settings, and creating the initial administrative
     structure.

     ### Inputs

     ### Acceptance Criteria

     0. PR and new branch created
     1. Git Project created for issue tracking
     2. Milestones created based on application plan phases
     3. Labels imported for issue management
     4. Filenames changed to match project name

     ### Assignment

     Your assignment is to set up an existing repository for a project. This involves configuring the necessary
     settings. You will create a new issue-tracking project, import labels, and create milestones. You will rename
     workspace and devcontainer files to match the project name.

     ### Detailed Steps

     1. **Create PR and New Branch**
        - Create a new branch named after the invoking dynamic workflow assignment which called this workflow
     assignment, with the prefix `dynamic-workflow-`.
        - For example, if the dynamic workflow assignment is `project-setup`, the branch should be named
     `dynamic-workflow-project-setup`.
        - Create a pull request (PR) for the new branch to merge into `main`
        - Changes will most likely not be made until subsequent workflow assignmments invoked after this one, so it will
      be left open until all subsequent assignments are complete and approved.
        - Later workflow assignments will commit and push changes to this branch.

     2. **Create GitHub Project for Issue Tracking**
        - Create a new GitHub Project for issue tracking
        - Name the project the same as the repository
        - Set the project to `Board` template

     3. **Import Labels**
        - Import the labels from the `.labels.json` file in the root of the repository
        - Use the `import-labels.ps1` script to import the labels

     4.  **Rename Workspace and Devcontainer Files**
        - Inside the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file rename the `name` property to use the repository name as the
      prefix, preserving the "devcontainer" suffix. Template: `<repo-name>-devcontainer`
        - Rename the `ai-new-app-template.code-workspace` file to use the repository name as the prefix, preserving the
     ".code-workspace" extension. Template: `<repo-name>.code-workspace`

     ### Completion

     After all steps have been completed, notify the orchestrator that this assignment has been completed and obtain
     approval to move to the next step. The repository has been initiated and is ready for the next step.

  ⎿  # AGENTS.md

     ## MCP Tools (MANDATORY for ALL agents)

     - **Sequential Thinking**: ALWAYS use `mcp_sequential_thinking_*` for planning, breaking down tasks, and analyzing
     dependencies.
     - **Memory**: ALWAYS use `mcp_memory_*` for context storage, state management, and caching patterns/conventions.
     - **Gemini**: USE `mcp_gemini_*` for large codebase analysis (1M token context), conserve Claude's context window
     - **Required MCP Servers**: filesystem, github, sequential-thinking, memory, gemini-cli MUST be configured

     ## Build/Lint/Test

     - Orchestration: use your agent to orchestrate workflows per remote instructions (Claude agents only)
     - Tests (.NET): `dotnet test` | single `dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~TestName"`

     ## Coding Style
     - Formatting: Prettier/EditorConfig/trunk if present; target ~100 cols
     - Naming: kebab-case files; PascalCase types/classes; camelCase vars/functions; CONSTANT_CASE constants
     - Errors: fail fast; never swallow; wrap async with try/catch; surface exit codes
     - Git: small focused commits; no secrets; never change git config

     ## Agent-Instructions & Workflows
     - SSOT: use `nam20485/agent-instructions@main` via RAW URLs; see `local_ai_instruction_modules/*` indices
     - Dynamic workflows: resolve by shortId from remote RAW files and orchestrate via your agent (no local script)
     - Assignments: resolve by shortId from `ai-workflow-assignments.md`; follow acceptance criteria verbatim
     - Tool priority: Sequential Thinking ␦ Memory ␦ Gemini (for large contexts) ␦ MCP GitHub tools ␦ VS Code ␦ `gh` CLI;
     avoid GitHub web UI; scripts `./scripts/*.ps1`; .NET SDK via `global.json` (9.0.102)

     ## Client-specific Rules

     Select and read based on which client you are.

     ### Copilot Rules
     - `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (shell detect, RAW URLs, automation-first, web-fetch disabled ␦ use
     `Invoke-WebRequest`/`curl`)

     ### Gemini rules
     - `.gemini/GEMINI.md` (shell detect, RAW URLs, automation-first, web-fetch disabled ␦ use
     `Invoke-WebRequest`/`curl`)

     ### Claude Code rules
     - `CLAUDE.md` (shell detect, RAW URLs, automation-first, web-fetch disabled ␦ use `Invoke-WebRequest`/`curl`)
     - Use the `orchestrator` agent to run dynamic workflows. Have this agent delegate tasks to other agents as needed.

     ## **IMPORTANT/CRITICAL RULES**

     For all clients.

     **CRITICAL**: All agents MUST use Sequential Thinking for task planning, Memory for state management, and Gemini
     for large-scale code analysis.

     .SYNOPSIS
         Import labels into a GitHub repository from a JSON export file.

     .DESCRIPTION
         Reads a JSON file (array of label objects as exported via:
             gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/labels --paginate > .labels.json
         ) and ensures the target repository has the same labels.

         - Creates missing labels
         - Updates color/description when they differ
         - Optionally deletes labels not present in the source file

     .PARAMETER Repo
         Target repository in the form "owner/repo" (e.g., "nam20485/agent-instructions").

     .PARAMETER LabelsFile
         Path to the JSON labels file (default: ./.labels.json).

     .PARAMETER DryRun
         Show what would change without making any changes.

     .PARAMETER DeleteMissing
         Delete labels in the target repo that are not present in the source file.

     .EXAMPLE
         # Preview changes
         ./scripts/import-labels.ps1 -Repo "owner/target-repo" -LabelsFile "./.labels.json" -DryRun

     .EXAMPLE
         # Apply changes (create/update)
         ./scripts/import-labels.ps1 -Repo "owner/target-repo" -LabelsFile "./.labels.json"

  ⎿ # Assignment: Create Application Plan

    ## (create-app-plan)

    ### Goal

    Your goal is to create a plan for application, using the template in Appendix A, based on a filled-out new
    application template and its supporting documents.

    ### Acceptance Criteria

    1. Application template has been thoroughly analyzed and understood
    2. Plan's project structure has been created according to established guidelines and plan
    3. Template from Appendix A has been used as a template for the plan.
    4. Plan contains detailed breakdown of all phases required to achieve complete implementation.
    5. All phases list important steps required to achieve completion of that phase.
    6. All required components and dependencies have been planned.
    7. Application plan follows the specified technology stack and design principles
    8. All mandatory application requirements have been addressed in plan. (testing, documentation,
    containerization, etc.)
    9. All acceptance criteria from the template have been addressed in the plan.
    10. All risks and mitigations identified.
    11. Code quality standards and best practices have been followed.
    12. Application plan is ready for development and implementation.
    13. Application plan has been documented in an issue using the template in #Appendix A.
    14. Milestones have been created and issues linked to the appropriate milestone.

    ### Assignment

    Your assignment is to create a new application plan based on a filled-out application template and its
    supporting documents. This involves systematic analysis of requirements, careful implementation following
    established guidelines, and delivery of a application plan that meets all specified criteria. You will use the
    template in #Appendix A as a template for the plan, and then fill in the details for the specific application.

    The application template can be found in the `docs/` directory in a file called `ai-new-app-template.md`. The
    supporting files are linked to in that file and are also included in the same directory. These files contain
    all the necessary details about the application you need to create the plan for, including features,
    components, and requirements.

    Specifically, you will:

    1. Analyze the filled-out application template and linked supporting documents to understand requirements and
    expectations and then create a comprehensive plan, documented as an issue (use the template in #Appendix A),
    for the development of the application. There is no coding in this assignment. It is strictly planning. Create
    the milestones and link the issues to the appropriate milestone.

    **Always follow instructions given here and as described in the task-based workflow process.**

    It is important to the final quality of our product for everyone to perform their assignment exactly as
    specified.

        * https://github.com/nam20485/advanced-memory3/issues/12
        * https://github.com/nam20485/support-assistant/issues/2

    ### Detailed Steps

    1. **Analyze the Application Template**
       - Review the provided application template and any linked documents
       - Identify all requirements, features, and components that need to be implemented
       - Understand the technology stack and design principles to be followed
       - Identify and clarify any ambiguous or unclear requirements with stakeholders
       - Identify languages, frameworks, tools, and packages to be used. Document in `docs/tech-stack.md`.
       - Document high level architecture, components, and design decisions in `docs/architecture.md`.

    2. **Design Plan**
       - Create a detailed design plan based on the new app template
       - Define the project structure, including directories, files, and naming conventions
       - Identify necessary frameworks, tools, and packages to be used
       - Plan for testing, documentation, containerization, and other mandatory requirements
       - Create Issue documenting plan from the #Appendix A plan template and iterate to gain approval from the
    orchestrator or stakeholders
       - Create milestones based on the phases in the plan and link issues to the appropriate milestone.

    ### Completion

    - Ask the stake-holder if they are happy with the plan and can approve it. If not then make the requested
    changes and iterate asking for approval and making changes until approval is gained.
    - **DO NOT IMPLEMENT OR WRITE ANY CODE.**
    - This assignment is planning only.
    - Ask the stake-holder for your next assignment.

    ## Appendix A: Application Plan Issue Template (Copy-Paste)

    Use the template below when you “Create Issue documenting plan” in step 2. It aligns with the Acceptance
    Criteria and covers all mandatory areas (testing, docs, containerization, CI/CD, security, risks, etc.). Copy
    this into a new GitHub Issue and fill in the placeholders.

    **TEMPLATE MOVED**.

    Template has been moved to [application-plan.md](/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/application-plan.md) file under the
    [.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/](/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/) directory in the root of the repository.

● ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  Planning Phase Separation
  - This assignment is strictly planning - no code implementation allowed
  - Uses issue-based planning with a structured template for consistency
  - Milestones align with the plan phases to track progress across the entire project lifecycle

     # System Architecture

     ## Overview
     The Advanced Memory System is a next-generation AI agent platform that combines deep, structured knowledge
     retrieval (GraphRAG) with stateful, personalized agentic memory (Mem0), unified under the Model Context Protocol
     (MCP). The system implements a "dual-brain" cognitive architecture inspired by the technical report specifications.

     ## Architecture Principles
     1. **Separation of Concerns** - Each service handles a distinct cognitive function
     2. **Modularity** - Components can be developed, scaled, and replaced independently
     3. **Stateless Services, Stateful Storage** - APIs are stateless; all state in databases
     4. **Orchestration over Complexity** - High-level composite tools simplify agent logic
     5. **Verification First** - All generated facts verified before user presentation

     ## High-Level Architecture

     # Advanced Memory System – Complete Implementation Plan

     ## Overview
     The Advanced Memory System implements a next-generation AI agent cognitive architecture combining GraphRAG
     (structured knowledge retrieval) with Mem0 (stateful agentic memory), unified under the Model Context Protocol
     (MCP). Based on the comprehensive technical report in `docs/Enhanced Technical Report on Architecting and
     Implementing a Unified Knowledge and Memory Server.md`, this system creates a "dual-brain" architecture where
     agents possess both deep domain expertise and personalized, evolving memory.

     **Problem Statement:** Current AI agents lack the combination of:
     1. Deep, relational knowledge understanding (beyond simple vector search)
     2. Persistent, personalized memory across sessions
     3. Factual verification and grounding
     4. Intelligent orchestration of complex workflows

     **Desired Outcomes:**
     - AI agents that can reason over complex, multi-hop relationships in knowledge
     - Personalized experiences that evolve with each user interaction
     - Verified, trustworthy responses with reduced hallucinations

     ## Risk Mitigation Strategies
     | Risk | Mitigation |
     |------|------------|
     | **Mem0 Python SDK integration complexity** | Create a thin REST wrapper service in Python, or port core
     functionality to C# if performance is critical. Use Docker for isolated Python runtime. |
     | **Neo4j cost for development** | Use Neo4j Community Edition in Docker for local dev. Switch to AuraDB free tier
     or managed service for staging/production. Alternatively, use Parquet files for GraphRAG in development. |
     | **GraphRAG indexing performance** | Batch document processing, use smaller LLM for extraction (gpt-4o-mini),
     implement incremental indexing. Monitor costs and implement rate limiting. |
     | **Vector search latency** | Tune top_k parameter (3-5), use metadata filtering, implement aggressive caching
     (Redis), choose appropriate embedding model size. |
     | **Service coordination complexity** | Use .NET Aspire for local orchestration, implement robust circuit breakers
     (Polly), comprehensive distributed tracing, workflow state machines. |
     | **LLM API costs** | Cache frequent queries, use cheaper models where possible (gpt-4o-mini for extraction),
     implement request batching, set budget alerts. |
     | **Multi-tenancy data leakage** | Strict user_id validation at every layer, integration tests for isolation, code
     reviews focused on authorization, database-level row security if available. |
     | **Knowledge graph schema drift** | Version control for graph schema, migration scripts, backward-compatible
     changes, comprehensive integration tests on schema updates. |
     | **Deployment complexity** | Comprehensive IaC (Terraform), detailed deployment documentation, automated smoke
     tests post-deployment, rollback procedures. |

     ## Timeline Estimate
     - **Phase 1 (Foundation):** 1-2 weeks
     - **Phase 2 (GraphRAG Service):** 2-3 weeks
     - **Phase 3 (Memory Service):** 2-3 weeks
     - **Phase 4 (Verification & Orchestration):** 2 weeks
     - **Phase 5 (MCP & UI):** 2-3 weeks
     - **Phase 6 (Testing, Docs, Packaging):** 2-3 weeks
     - **Total:** 11-16 weeks (approximately 3-4 months)

     **Notes:**
     - Timeline assumes 1-2 full-time developers
     - Phases 2 and 3 can partially overlap if team has multiple developers
     - Buffer time included for learning curve on GraphRAG and Mem0
     - Assumes familiarity with .NET, Docker, and basic AI/ML concepts

     ## Success Metrics
     - **Functionality:** All 6 implementation phases completed with acceptance criteria met
     - **Code Quality:** ≥80% test coverage, zero high-severity security issues, all CI checks green
     - **Performance:** Knowledge queries <2s, memory searches <500ms, orchestration <3s (95th percentile)
     - **Scalability:** System handles ≥100 concurrent users and ≥10K documents indexed
     - **Reliability:** ≥99% uptime in test environment, successful failover tests
     - **Documentation:** 100% of public APIs documented, user guide covers all UI features
     - **Deployment:** Successful automated deployment to at least one cloud environment
     - **Developer Experience:** New developer can run full stack locally in <30 minutes using provided scripts

     ## Repository Branch
     **Target branch for implementation:** `dynamic-workflow-setup-project-and-create-app`

     This branch will contain all development work and will be merged to `main` via PR #1 upon completion.

     ## Implementation Notes

     ### Key Assumptions
     1. **GraphRAG Implementation Choice:** Will primarily use Microsoft GraphRAG library via CLI wrapper for ease of
     use, with option to migrate to Neo4j GraphRAG SDK for production if native graph queries are needed.
     2. **Mem0 Integration:** Will wrap Mem0 Python SDK via REST API initially; port to C# if performance demands it in
     production.
     3. **LLM Provider:** OpenAI API is the primary LLM provider for development; architecture supports swapping to
     Azure OpenAI or local models.
     4. **Development Environment:** Assumes Windows development with PowerShell, Docker Desktop, and .NET 9.0 SDK
     installed.
     5. **Cloud Target:** Architecture is cloud-agnostic but Terraform will initially target Azure (AKS, Cosmos
     DB/AuraDB, Qdrant Cloud).

     ### Design Decisions (to be documented as ADRs)
     - **ADR-001:** Choice of .NET Aspire for local orchestration vs Kubernetes
     - **ADR-002:** Microsoft GraphRAG vs Neo4j GraphRAG vs LlamaIndex for knowledge layer
     - **ADR-003:** Mem0 Python SDK wrapper vs C# port
     - **ADR-004:** Model Context Protocol vs direct REST APIs for agent communication
     - **ADR-005:** SSE vs WebSockets for real-time UI updates
     - **ADR-006:** Blazor WebAssembly vs Blazor Server for UI
     - **ADR-007:** Parquet vs Neo4j for GraphRAG storage in development

     ### References to Technical Documents
     - See Section 3 of the technical report for detailed GraphRAG implementation options
     - See Section 4 for Mem0 SDK integration patterns
     - See Section 5 for MCP server architecture
     - See Section 6 for advanced strategies (verification layer, orchestration, feedback loops)

     ### Adaptation Notes
     The implementation adapts the research-oriented technical report into a production .NET application by:
     1. Replacing Python-heavy examples with C# ASP.NET Core services
     2. Adding .NET Aspire for cloud-native orchestration
     3. Including Blazor WebAssembly for real-time visualization
     4. Emphasizing CI/CD and production deployment patterns
     5. Adding comprehensive testing and documentation requirements
     6. Providing Terraform for reproducible infrastructure

     The core architectural principles and cognitive patterns from the report are preserved while making the system
     production-ready and developer-friendly.

     Risk Analysis & Mitigation

     The plan identifies 9 critical risks with mitigation strategies:

     1. Mem0 Python Integration → REST wrapper or C# port
     2. Neo4j Development Costs → Community Edition + Docker
     3. GraphRAG Indexing Performance → Batching, smaller LLMs, incremental indexing
     4. Vector Search Latency → Caching, top_k tuning, metadata filtering
     5. Service Coordination Complexity → .NET Aspire + Polly + distributed tracing

     Reference Examples Reviewed

     I reviewed the two excellent prior plans as references:
     1. advanced-memory3#12 - Demonstrated comprehensive task breakdown and clear phase structure
     2. support-assistant#2 - Showed effective risk mitigation and acceptance criteria definition

     The current plan incorporates best practices from both while addressing the unique complexity of the GraphRAG +
      Mem0 architecture.

     ---
     Key Clarifications & Decisions Made

     Decision 1: GraphRAG Implementation Strategy

     Choice: Start with Microsoft GraphRAG library (CLI wrapper), migrate to Neo4j GraphRAG SDK if needed
     Rationale: Lower initial complexity, faster prototyping, option to upgrade

     Decision 2: Mem0 Integration Approach

     Choice: Python SDK via REST wrapper initially
     Rationale: Leverage proven SDK, avoid reimplementation, can port to C# later if needed

     Decision 3: .NET Aspire vs Kubernetes

     Choice: .NET Aspire for local dev, path to Kubernetes for production
     Rationale: Superior local dev experience, aligns with .NET 9.0, natural migration path

     Decision 4: Six Phases vs Traditional Five

     Choice: Six phases (split Verification+Orchestration from Testing+Deployment)
     Rationale: Better reflects technical complexity, clearer dependencies

     # Advanced Memory System – Complete Implementation Plan

     ## Overview
     The Advanced Memory System implements a next-generation AI agent cognitive architecture combining GraphRAG
     (structured knowledge retrieval) with Mem0 (stateful agentic memory), unified under the Model Context Protocol
     (MCP). Based on the comprehensive technical report in `docs/Enhanced Technical Report on Architecting and
     Implementing a Unified Knowledge and Memory Server.md`, this system creates a "dual-brain" architecture where
     agents possess both deep domain expertise and personalized, evolving memory.

     **Problem Statement:** Current AI agents lack the combination of:
     1. Deep, relational knowledge understanding (beyond simple vector search)
     2. Persistent, personalized memory across sessions
     3. Factual verification and grounding
     4. Intelligent orchestration of complex workflows

     **Desired Outcomes:**
     - AI agents that can reason over complex, multi-hop relationships in knowledge
     - Personalized experiences that evolve with each user interaction
     - Verified, trustworthy responses with reduced hallucinations
     - Scalable, production-ready architecture

     **Supporting Documents:**
     - Application Template: `docs/ai-new-app-template.md`
     - Technical Report: `docs/Enhanced Technical Report on Architecting and Implementing a Unified Knowledge and Memory
      Server.md`
     - Interactive Overview: `docs/index.html`
     - Technology Stack: `docs/tech-stack.md`
     - Architecture: `docs/architecture.md`

     ## Goals
     - Create a production-ready implementation of the GraphRAG + Mem0 architecture
     - Demonstrate the "dual-brain" cognitive pattern with real use cases
     - Build a reusable template for advanced AI agent systems
     - Provide comprehensive documentation and best practices
     - Enable multi-user, scalable deployment

     ## Technology Stack
     - **Language:** C# .NET 9.0
     - **Application Framework:** .NET Aspire, ASP.NET Core Web API, Blazor WebAssembly
     - **AI/ML:** Microsoft GraphRAG, Neo4j GraphRAG SDK, Mem0 SDK, OpenAI API
     - **Databases:** Neo4j (graph), Qdrant (vectors), Parquet (lightweight storage)
     - **Architecture Patterns:** MCP (Model Context Protocol), SSE (Server-Sent Events), Microservices
     - **Observability:** Serilog, OpenTelemetry, .NET Aspire Dashboard
     - **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose, Terraform
     - **Testing:** xUnit, Moq, FluentAssertions, TestContainers
     - **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions

     See `docs/tech-stack.md` for complete details.

     ## Application Features
     - **GraphRAG Knowledge Service** - Deep, structured knowledge retrieval with global/local search
     - **Mem0 Memory Service** - Stateful, personalized agent memory with graph relationships
     - **Verification Service** - Fast fact-checking against trusted sources
     - **Orchestration Service** - Multi-step workflow coordination
     - **MCP Server** - Standardized agent-to-tool communication layer
     - **Blazor UI** - Real-time visualization of system activity and knowledge graphs
     - **Multi-User Support** - Isolated memory per user, shared knowledge base
     - **Feedback Loops** - Self-improving system learning from user interactions

     ## System Architecture

     ### Core Services Architecture
     The system implements a microservices architecture orchestrated by .NET Aspire:

     1. **GraphRAG Knowledge Service** - ASP.NET Core Web API
        - Entity and relationship extraction from documents
        - Knowledge graph construction and querying
        - Global search (thematic queries) and local search (entity-specific)
        - Community detection and summarization

     2. **Mem0 Memory Service** - ASP.NET Core Web API (wrapping Python SDK or REST)
        - Working, episodic, factual, and semantic memory types
        - User-isolated memory storage with graph relationships
        - Semantic search and memory evolution tracking

     3. **Verification Service** - ASP.NET Core Web API
        - Lightweight RAG against trusted corpus
        - Fact verification and confidence scoring
        - Hallucination reduction layer

     4. **Orchestration Service** - ASP.NET Core Web API
        - High-level composite workflow execution
        - Parallel service call coordination
        - Workflow logging and observability

     5. **MCP Server** - FastAPI or ASP.NET Core
        - Model Context Protocol implementation
        - Tool exposure to AI agents
        - SSE streaming for real-time updates

     6. **Blazor WebAssembly UI**
        - Real-time system activity visualization
        - Knowledge graph explorer
        - User memory timeline
        - Service health dashboard

     See `docs/architecture.md` for detailed architecture diagrams and data flows.

     # Advanced Memory System

     A next-generation AI agent cognitive architecture combining GraphRAG (structured knowledge retrieval) with Mem0
     (stateful agentic memory), unified under the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

     ## Overview

     The Advanced Memory System implements a "dual-brain" architecture where AI agents possess both deep domain
     expertise and personalized, evolving memory. This system addresses the key limitations of current AI agents:

     - **GraphRAG Knowledge Service**: Deep, relational knowledge understanding with multi-hop reasoning
     - **Mem0 Memory Service**: Persistent, personalized memory that evolves across sessions
     - **Verification Service**: Factual verification and grounding to reduce hallucinations
     - **Orchestration Service**: Intelligent coordination of complex, multi-step workflows
     - **MCP Server**: Standardized agent-to-tool communication layer
     - **Blazor Web UI**: Real-time visualization of system activity and knowledge graphs

     ## Architecture

     The system is built using a microservices architecture orchestrated by .NET Aspire:

     # Getting Started with Advanced Memory System

     This guide will help you get the Advanced Memory System up and running on your local development machine.

     ## Prerequisites

     Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

     ### Required

     - **.NET 9.0 SDK** - [Download here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0)
     - **Docker Desktop** - [Download here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
     - **OpenAI API Key** - [Get one here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

     ### Optional but Recommended

     - **Visual Studio 2022** or **VS Code** with C# extension
     - **Git** for version control
     - **PowerShell 7+** (comes with .NET SDK on Windows)

     ## Installation Steps

     ### 1. Clone the Repository

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/nam20485/advanced-memory-tango32.git
     cd advanced-memory-tango32
     ```

     ### 2. Run the Setup Script

     The setup script will:
     - Verify prerequisites
     - Create your `.env` file from the template
     - Start Docker containers (Neo4j, Qdrant)
     - Build the solution

     ```bash
     pwsh ./scripts/setup-dev-env.ps1
     ```

     ### 3. Configure Environment Variables

     Edit the `.env` file and add your OpenAI API key:

     ```bash
     OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here
     ```

     You may also want to customize other settings:

     ```bash
     # Choose your preferred OpenAI models
     OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o
     OPENAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL=text-embedding-3-small

     # Adjust logging levels
     SERILOG_MINIMUM_LEVEL=Information
     ```

     ### 4. Verify Installation

     Check that Docker containers are running:

     ```bash
     docker ps
     ```

     You should see containers for:
     - `advanced-memory-neo4j`
     - `advanced-memory-qdrant`

     ### 5. Run the Application

     Start all services using .NET Aspire:

     ```bash
     pwsh ./scripts/run-local.ps1
     ```

     This will:
     - Start the .NET Aspire AppHost
     - Launch all microservices
     - Open the Aspire dashboard

     ## Accessing the Services

     Once running, you can access:

     | Service | URL | Credentials |
     |---------|-----|-------------|
     | Web UI | http://localhost:5000 | - |
     | .NET Aspire Dashboard | http://localhost:15888 | - |
     | Neo4j Browser | http://localhost:7474 | neo4j/password123 |
     | Qdrant Dashboard | http://localhost:6333/dashboard | - |
     | GraphRAG Service API | http://localhost:5001/swagger | - |
     | Memory Service API | http://localhost:5002/swagger | - |
     | Verification Service API | http://localhost:5003/swagger | - |
     | Orchestration Service API | http://localhost:5004/swagger | - |
     | MCP Server API | http://localhost:5005/swagger | - |

     ## First Steps

     ### 1. Explore the Aspire Dashboard

     The .NET Aspire Dashboard (http://localhost:15888) provides:
     - Real-time metrics for all services
     - Distributed tracing
     - Logs aggregation
     - Health status monitoring

     ### 2. Try the Web UI

     Navigate to http://localhost:5000 to:
     - View the knowledge graph visualization
     - Interact with the memory system
     - Monitor service activity
     - Execute test queries

     ### 3. Test the APIs

     Each service exposes a Swagger UI for API exploration:

     **Example: Add knowledge to GraphRAG**
     ```bash
     curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/knowledge \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{
         "text": "GraphRAG is a knowledge retrieval system that uses graphs.",
         "source": "user-input"
       }'
     ```

     **Example: Create a memory**
     ```bash
     curl -X POST http://localhost:5002/api/memories \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{
         "userId": "user-123",
         "content": "I prefer concise technical explanations.",
         "memoryType": "preference"
       }'
     ```

     ## Development Workflow

     ### Building the Solution

     ```bash
     dotnet build AdvancedMemorySystem.sln
     ```

     ### Running Tests

     ```bash
     # All tests
     dotnet test AdvancedMemorySystem.sln

     # Unit tests only
     dotnet test tests/AdvancedMemorySystem.UnitTests

     # With coverage
     dotnet test /p:CollectCoverage=true /p:CoverletOutputFormat=opencover
     ```

     ### Debugging

     **Using Visual Studio:**
     1. Open `AdvancedMemorySystem.sln`
     2. Set `AdvancedMemorySystem.AppHost` as startup project
     3. Press F5 to debug

     **Using VS Code:**
     1. Open the project folder
     2. Use the pre-configured launch configurations
     3. Select "Launch AppHost" and press F5

     ### Making Changes

     1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`
     2. Make your changes
     3. Run tests: `dotnet test`
     4. Commit: `git commit -m "Add my feature"`
     5. Push and create a PR

     ## Troubleshooting

     ### Docker containers won't start

     **Issue:** Neo4j or Qdrant fails to start

     **Solution:**
     ```bash
     # Stop all containers
     docker-compose down

     # Remove volumes
     docker-compose down -v

     # Restart
     docker-compose up -d
     ```

     ### Build errors

     **Issue:** "TreatWarningsAsErrors" causes build to fail

     **Solution:** Fix the warnings or temporarily disable in `Directory.Build.props`:
     ```xml
     <TreatWarningsAsErrors>false</TreatWarningsAsErrors>
     ```

     ### Port conflicts

     **Issue:** Port already in use

     **Solution:** Either:
     - Stop the conflicting service
     - Change ports in `docker-compose.yml` and `.env`

     ### OpenAI API errors

     **Issue:** 401 Unauthorized or rate limit errors

     **Solution:**
     - Verify your API key in `.env`
     - Check your OpenAI account has credits
     - Reduce request frequency

     # Creating Repository Custom Instructions

     This file contains instructions for creating a custom summary of a repository.

     ## Goal

     - Create custom summary of a repository.
     - Place the custom instructions in the `.ai-repository-summary.md` file, located at the root of the repository.
     - Link to other instruction files as needed.

     ## Documentation

     - [Writing effective repository custom instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/configure-custom-in
     structions/add-repository-instructions?tool=webui#creating-a-repository-custom-instructions-file)

     * Note: You are not to write or include any instructions in this file, but to only use the instructions from the
     documentation that are relevant to creating a summary of the properties of a repository.

     ## Instructions for Creating Repository Summary

     Your task is to "onboard" this repository to Copilot coding agent by adding a `.ai-repository-summary.md` file in
     the repository that contains information describing how a coding agent seeing it for the first time can work most
     efficiently.

     You will do this task only one time per repository and doing a good job can SIGNIFICANTLY improve the quality of
     the agent's work, so take your time, think carefully, and search thoroughly before writing the instructions.

     <Goals>
     - Reduce the likelihood of a coding agent pull request getting rejected by the user due to
     generating code that fails the continuous integration build, fails a validation pipeline, or
     having misbehavior.
     - Minimize bash command and build failures.
     - Allow the agent to complete its task more quickly by minimizing the need for exploration using grep, find,
     str_replace_editor, and code search tools.
     </Goals>

     <Limitations>
     - Instructions must be no longer than 2 pages.
     - Instructions must not be task specific.
     </Limitations>

     <WhatToAdd>

     Add the following high level details about the codebase to reduce the amount of searching the agent has to do to
     understand the codebase each time:
     <HighLevelDetails>

     - A summary of what the repository does.
     - High level repository information, such as the size of the repo, the type of the project, the languages,
     frameworks, or target runtimes in use.
     </HighLevelDetails>

     Add information about how to build and validate changes so the agent does not need to search and find it each time.
     <BuildInstructions>

     - For each of bootstrap, build, test, run, lint, and any other scripted step, document the sequence of steps to
     take to run it successfully as well as the versions of any runtime or build tools used.
     - Each command should be validated by running it to ensure that it works correctly as well as any preconditions and
      postconditions.
     - Try cleaning the repo and environment and running commands in different orders and document errors and and
     misbehavior observed as well as any steps used to mitigate the problem.
     - Run the tests and document the order of steps required to run the tests.
     - Make a change to the codebase. Document any unexpected build issues as well as the workarounds.
     - Document environment setup steps that seem optional but that you have validated are actually required.
     - Document the time required for commands that failed due to timing out.
     - When you find a sequence of commands that work for a particular purpose, document them in detail.
     - Use language to indicate when something should always be done. For example: "always run npm install before
building".
     - Record any validation steps from documentation.
     </BuildInstructions>

     List key facts about the layout and architecture of the codebase to help the agent find where to make changes with
     minimal searching.
     <ProjectLayout>

     - A description of the major architectural elements of the project, including the relative paths to the main
     project files, the location
     of configuration files for linting, compilation, testing, and preferences.
     - A description of the checks run prior to check in, including any GitHub workflows, continuous integration builds,
      or other validation pipelines.
     - Document the steps so that the agent can replicate these itself.
     - Any explicit validation steps that the agent can consider to have further confidence in its changes.
     - Dependencies that aren't obvious from the layout or file structure.
     - Finally, fill in any remaining space with detailed lists of the following, in order of priority: the list of
     files in the repo root, the
     contents of the README, the contents of any key source files, the list of files in the next level down of
     directories, giving priority to the more structurally important and snippets of code from key source files, such as
      the one containing the main method.
     </ProjectLayout>
     </WhatToAdd>

     <StepsToFollow>
     - Perform a comprehensive inventory of the codebase. Search for and view:
        - README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, and all other documentation files.
        - Search the codebase for build steps and indications of workarounds like 'HACK', 'TODO', etc.
        - All scripts, particularly those pertaining to build and repo or environment setup.
        - All build and actions pipelines.
        - All project files.
        - All configuration and linting files.
     - For each file:
        - Think: is the content (or existence) something the coding agent will need to implement, build, test, validate,
      or demo a code change?
        - If yes:
           - Document the command or information in detail.
           - Explicitly indicate which commands work and which do not and the order in which commands should be run.
           - Document any errors encountered and the steps taken to work around them.
     - Document any other steps or information that the agent can use to reduce time spent exploring or running failing
     commands.
     - Finally, explicitly instruct the agent to trust the instructions and only perform a search if the information in
     the instructions is incomplete or found to be in error.
     </StepsToFollow>

     ## Writing effective repository custom instructions
     The instructions you add to your custom instruction file(s) should be short, self-contained statements that provide
      Copilot with relevant information to help it work in this repository. Because the instructions are sent with every
      chat message, they should be broadly applicable to most requests you will make in the context of the repository.

     The exact structure you utilize for your instructions file(s) will vary by project and need, but the following
     guidelines provide a good starting point:

     - Provide an overview of the project you're working on, including its purpose, goals, and any relevant background
     information.
     - Include the folder structure of the repository, including any important directories or files that are relevant to
      the project.
     - Specify the coding standards and conventions that should be followed, such as naming conventions, formatting
     rules, and best practices.
     - Include any specific tools, libraries, or frameworks that are used in the project, along with any relevant
     version numbers or configurations.

     ### Example

     The following instructions file(s) is an example of these practices in action:

     ```markdown
