  6. Consider asynchronous review process

#### Error: Incomplete Metrics or Statistics
- **Symptoms**: Missing data for Metrics and Statistics section
- **Possible Causes**:
  - Metrics not tracked during project
  - Build/test data not saved
  - No automated metrics collection
  - Data scattered across multiple sources
- **Solutions**:
  1. Use git statistics: `git log --stat`, `git diff --stat`
  2. Count files: `find . -name "*.ts" | wc -l`
  3. Use tools like `cloc` for lines of code
  4. Review package.json/requirements.txt for dependencies
  5. Check test runner output for test counts
  6. Document "Metrics not available" with explanation

#### Error: Git Commit or Push Fails
- **Symptoms**: Unable to commit or push report to repository
- **Possible Causes**:
  - Working directory has uncommitted changes
  - Branch protection rules blocking push
  - Network connectivity issues
  - Authentication failures
  - Conflicts with remote changes
- **Solutions**:
  1. Verify git status and commit any pending changes
