  * Sometimes also documented in `APP_PLAN.md` file in the root of the repository
* Application template and linked supporting documents
  * This can be found in the `plan_docs/ai-new-app-template.md` file in the root of the repository
  * Supporting documents are linked from the app template and are also included in the `plan_docs/` directory

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Project initialized with version control (git)
2. Dependency manifest created and dependencies installable
3. Build system configured and builds successfully
4. Code quality tools configured and pass on empty project
5. Directory structure created following established conventions

## Error Recovery

If an error occurs during this assignment, follow these steps:

### Common Errors

#### Error: Dependency Installation Fails
- **Symptoms**: Package installation errors, network timeouts, version conflicts
- **Possible Causes**: 
  - Network connectivity issues
  - Incompatible runtime version
  - Corrupted package cache
  - Version conflicts between dependencies
- **Solutions**:
  1. Verify runtime version matches requirements (Node.js, Python, etc.)
  2. Clear package cache (e.g., `npm cache clean --force`, `pip cache purge`)
  3. Check network connectivity and proxy settings
  4. Try installing with legacy/compatibility flags if needed
  5. Check for known issues with specific package versions

#### Error: Build Configuration Invalid
- **Symptoms**: Build fails with configuration errors, syntax errors in config files
- **Possible Causes**:
  - Syntax errors in configuration files
  - Invalid configuration options
  - Missing required configuration fields
  - Incompatible configuration settings
- **Solutions**:
  1. Validate configuration file syntax (JSON, YAML, etc.)
  2. Check documentation for correct configuration options
  3. Verify all required fields are present
  4. Test with minimal configuration first
  5. Compare with working examples from similar projects

#### Error: Linter/Formatter Configuration Fails
- **Symptoms**: Linter or formatter fails to run, configuration errors
- **Possible Causes**:
  - Invalid configuration syntax
  - Missing plugins or dependencies
  - Incompatible versions
  - Conflicting rules
- **Solutions**:
  1. Validate configuration file syntax
  2. Verify all required plugins are installed
  3. Check version compatibility between tools
  4. Start with minimal configuration and add rules incrementally
  5. Review documentation for correct configuration format

#### Error: Directory Creation Fails
- **Symptoms**: Cannot create directories, permission errors
- **Possible Causes**:
  - Insufficient permissions
  - Directory already exists
  - Invalid directory names
  - File system issues
- **Solutions**:
  1. Check file system permissions
  2. Verify directory doesn't already exist
  3. Ensure directory names are valid for the OS
  4. Try creating directories manually to test permissions
  5. Check available disk space

#### Error: Git Initialization Fails
- **Symptoms**: Git commands fail, repository not initialized
- **Possible Causes**:
  - Git not installed
  - Already a git repository
  - Insufficient permissions
  - Corrupted git configuration
- **Solutions**:
  1. Verify git is installed: `git --version`
  2. Check if already a git repository: `ls -la .git`
  3. Verify permissions in the directory
  4. Try initializing in a different directory
  5. Check global git configuration

### Escalation Procedure

If errors persist after troubleshooting:

1. **Document the Error**:
   - Full error message and stack trace
   - Steps that led to the error
   - Environment details (OS, runtime version, etc.)
   - What solutions were attempted
   - Any relevant configuration files

2. **Create an Issue**:
   - Create GitHub issue with error details
   - Tag with "bug" and "needs-investigation"
   - Link to this assignment
   - Include reproduction steps

3. **Notify User**:
   - Report the error to the user
   - Provide error details and context
   - Request manual intervention
   - Suggest potential next steps

4. **Do Not Proceed**:
   - Do not mark assignment as complete
   - Do not proceed to next assignment
   - Wait for error resolution
   - Document the blocker

### Rollback Procedure

If changes need to be reverted:

1. **Assess Impact**:
   - Determine what changes were made
   - Identify what needs to be rolled back
   - Check for dependencies on the changes

2. **Perform Rollback**:
   - Use git to revert changes: `git checkout -- .` or `git reset --hard`
   - Delete generated files/directories
   - Restore from backup if available
   - Clean build artifacts

3. **Verify Rollback**:
   - Confirm system is in previous state
   - Test that previous functionality still works
   - Verify no orphaned files remain

4. **Document Rollback**:
   - Document what was rolled back and why
   - Record lessons learned
   - Update issue/ticket with rollback details
   - Plan next steps

### Prevention Tips

To avoid common errors:

1. **Before Starting**:
   - Read assignment completely
   - Verify prerequisites are met
   - Check environment is properly configured
   - Ensure you have necessary permissions

2. **During Execution**:
   - Follow steps exactly as specified
   - Verify each step before proceeding
   - Test incrementally (don't wait until the end)
   - Keep notes of what you've done

3. **After Completion**:
   - Run all verification commands
   - Check acceptance criteria are met
   - Document any deviations from plan
   - Create validation report

### Completion

1. **Verify Foundation is Complete:**
   - All dependencies install successfully
   - Build command runs without errors
   - Linter and formatter pass on empty project
   - Directory structure matches conventions
   - Environment configuration is documented

2. **Present to Stakeholder:**
   - Demonstrate that dependencies install
   - Show that build works
   - Show that code quality tools are configured
   - Present the directory structure

3. **Stakeholder Review Process:**
   - Ask if they approve the foundation setup
   - Address any questions or requests for modifications
   - Make revisions if needed based on feedback

4. **Finalization:**
   - Commit all foundation files
   - Mark the foundation creation as complete once approved
   - Proceed to next assignment (Application Structure)

### Notes

- This assignment is tech-stack agnostic - adapt file names and tools to your specific technology
- Focus on establishing a solid foundation that follows best practices
- All applications need these foundational elements regardless of their purpose
- The foundation should be complete before moving to application structure
