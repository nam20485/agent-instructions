### Assignment

Your assignment is to orchestrate the initilation of a new repository, creating the project plan, creating the project structure, breaking down the work into epics and issues, and overseeing the implementation process. This involves systematic analysis of requirements, careful implementation following established guidelines, and delivery of a production-ready application that meets all specified criteria. You will be the orchestrator for the project, and will be responsible for all aspects of the project from start to finish. You will be the one to assign issues to the copilot, and will be responsible for reviewing and approving all work. For each stage, you will assign the copilot to perform the task, and then you will review and approve the work. You will iterate on each stage until it is approved.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Initialize Repository**
   -  You will assign the copilot the `initiaize-repository` assignment.
   -  You will wait until sub-agent finishes the task.
   -  You will review the work and approve it.
   -  Upon approval, you will move on to the next stage.

2. **Create Application Plan**
   -  You will assign the copilot the `create-app-plan` assignment.
   -  You will wait until sub-agent finishes the task.
   -  You will review the work and approve it.
   -  Upon approval, you will move on to the next stage.

3. **Create Project Structure**
   -  You will assign the copilot the `create-project-structure` assignment.
   -  You will wait until sub-agent finishes the task.
   -  You will review the work and approve it.
   -  Upon approval, you will move on to the next stage.

4. **Iteratively Breakdown Epics and Plan**
   - For each phase's sub-issue created in the previous `create-app-plan` step:
     - You will assign the copilot the `breakdown-epic-and-plan` assignment.
     - You will wait until sub-agent finishes the task.
     - You will review the work and approve it.
     - Upon approval, you will move on to the next sub-issue.
   - Upon approval, you will move on to the next stage.

5. **Iteratively Implement and Validate**
   - For each sub-issue created in the previous `breakdown-epic-and-plan` step:
     - You will assign the copilot the `perform-task` assignment.
     - You will wait until sub-agent finishes the task.
     - You will review the work and approve it.
     - Upon approval, you will move on to the next sub-issue.
   - Upon approval, you will move on to the next stage.

6. **Final Validation and Delivery**
   - You will assign verify that all work is complete and meets all acceptance criteria.
   - You will assign the copilot the `validate-and-deliver` assignment.
   - You will wait until sub-agent finishes the task.
   - You will review the work and approve it.
   - Upon approval, you will move on to the next stage.

### Completion
Once all stages are complete, the project is considered complete and the orchestrator's assignment is finished.
