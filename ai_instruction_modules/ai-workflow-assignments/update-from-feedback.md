### Assignment

You will review all documents in the feedback directory, categorize and prioritize feedback items, create detailed action plans for each category, implement or schedule changes, and document the entire process. This workflow handles multiple types of feedback including implementation gaps, quality issues, architectural concerns, performance problems, documentation needs, workflow improvements, testing gaps, and lessons learned.

### Feedback Categories Overview

This workflow handles 8 primary feedback categories, each requiring different types of actions:

1. **Implementation Status & Gaps** - Missing features, incomplete implementations, deferred items
2. **Quality & Validation Issues** - Build errors, lint warnings, TypeScript errors, code quality
3. **Architecture & Design Issues** - Incorrect configurations, design pattern violations, architectural misalignments
4. **Performance & Optimization** - Bundle size, rendering performance, memory usage, load times
5. **Documentation Gaps** - Missing docs, outdated content, incomplete API documentation
6. **Process & Workflow Improvements** - Workflow changes, agent enhancements, prompt improvements
7. **Testing & Quality Assurance** - Missing tests, coverage gaps, test infrastructure needs
8. **Lessons Learned & Best Practices** - What worked, what didn't, recommendations for future

### Detailed Steps

## Step 1: Review Feedback Documents

### 1.1 Access and Inventory Feedback
- Access the specified directory containing feedback documents
- Create an inventory of all feedback documents found
- Note the type of each document (debrief, test report, state report, execution summary, etc.)
- Record document metadata (date, author, workflow, status)

### 1.2 Read and Extract Feedback Items
For each document:
- Read through the entire document carefully
- Extract all feedback items, issues, suggestions, and recommendations
- Note the severity/priority indicated (critical, major, minor, enhancement)
- Capture context for each item (which story, feature, or component it relates to)
- Identify any metrics or measurements provided (coverage %, build time, bundle size, etc.)

### 1.3 Create Feedback Items List
Create a structured list with:
- **Item ID** (sequential numbering: FB-001, FB-002, etc.)
- **Source Document** (which feedback file it came from)
- **Category** (to be assigned in next step)
- **Title** (brief description)
- **Description** (full details)
- **Current State** (what exists now)

### 2.1 Categorization Process
For each feedback item:
1. Read the item description carefully
2. Match against identification criteria for each category
3. Assign primary category (most relevant)
4. Assign secondary categories if applicable (items can have multiple categories)
5. Record rationale for categorization

---

## Step 3: Prioritize Feedback Items

### 3.1 Assign Priority Levels

Use this prioritization matrix:

**Critical (P0) - Fix Immediately**
- Blocks core functionality
- Violates core requirements
- Causes build failures
- Security vulnerabilities
- Data loss risks

**High (P1) - Fix Soon**
- Significant functionality gaps
- Major performance issues
- Important features missing
- High-impact user experience issues
- Technical debt that will compound

**Medium (P2) - Schedule for Next Phase**
- Moderate improvements
- Nice-to-have features
- Documentation gaps
- Minor performance issues
- Code quality improvements

**Low (P3) - Backlog**
- Future enhancements
- Optimization opportunities
- Process improvements
- Long-term refactoring

### 3.2 Estimate Effort

For each item, estimate effort:
- **Small (S)**: < 2 hours, single file change, straightforward fix
- **Medium (M)**: 2-8 hours, multiple files, moderate complexity
- **Large (L)**: > 8 hours, multiple components, high complexity, requires design

### 3.3 Calculate Priority Score
Priority Score = (Severity Weight Ã— Impact) / Effort

Severity Weights:
- Critical: 10
- High: 5
- Medium: 2
- Low: 1

Impact (1-5 scale):
- 5: Affects all users, core functionality
- 4: Affects many users, important feature
- 3: Affects some users, useful feature
- 2: Affects few users, minor feature
- 1: Affects very few users, edge case

Sort feedback items by priority score (highest first).

- Consider context (what phase, what was the goal)
- Note patterns across multiple documents

### Categorization
- Items can have multiple categories (use primary + secondary)
- When in doubt, ask "what action does this require?"
- Group related items together

### Prioritization
- Be realistic about "Critical" - reserve for true blockers
- Consider implementation dependencies
- Balance quick wins with important work

### Issue Creation
- Write clear, actionable titles
- Include all context in description
- Link related issues
- Use consistent labeling

### Workflow Changes
- Be very specific about file and location
- Show before/after examples
- Explain the "why" not just the "what"
- Consider unintended consequences

### Communication
- Keep stakeholders informed
- Celebrate accomplishments
- Be transparent about deferred items
- Share lessons learned

## Examples

### Example: Handling a Complex Feedback Item

**Feedback from MVP_TEST_REPORT.md:**
> "No Unit Tests - Vitest is configured in package.json, but no test files exist in the codebase. Impact: Lack of automated testing for business logic and components. Recommendation: Add unit tests in Phase 2 for API client methods, store actions and state updates, utility functions, and component rendering."

**Step 1: Extract and Categorize**
- **FB-015**: No unit test coverage
- **Category**: Testing & Quality Assurance
- **Priority**: P1 (High - important for quality)
- **Effort**: Large (requires test infrastructure + multiple test suites)

**Step 2: Create Action Plan Entry**
```markdown
### FB-015: No Unit Test Coverage

**Current State**: 0% test coverage, Vitest configured but no tests exist
**Desired State**: >80% test coverage with unit tests for critical paths
**Priority**: P1 (High)
**Effort**: Large (20-30 hours)

**Actions:**
1. Create Epic: "Test Infrastructure and Coverage"
2. Create Stories:
   - Story: "Set up test infrastructure and CI integration"
   - Story: "Unit tests for API client layer"
   - Story: "Unit tests for state management (Zustand store)"
   - Story: "Unit tests for utility functions"
   - Story: "Component tests for React components"

**Success Metrics:**
- Test coverage: 0% â†’ 80%+
- All tests passing in CI
- Test execution time < 30 seconds
```

**Step 3: Create GitHub Issues**

Create Epic:
```bash
gh issue create \
  --title "[Epic]: Test Infrastructure and Coverage" \
  --label "epic,testing,priority-high" \
  --body "## Goal

### Example: Handling a Workflow Improvement

**Feedback from PROJECT_SETUP_DEBRIEF.md:**
> "Assignment Granularity - Issue: Some assignments were quite large and complex (e.g., create-project-structure). Suggestion: Consider breaking down large assignments into smaller, more focused tasks. Benefit: Smaller assignments are easier to test, debug, and reuse."

**Step 1: Extract and Categorize**
- **FB-023**: Assignment too large and complex
- **Category**: Process & Workflow Improvements
- **Priority**: P2 (Medium - improves future workflows)
- **Effort**: Medium (requires restructuring workflow file)

**Step 2: Create Workflow Change Documentation**
```markdown
### Change: Split create-project-structure Assignment

**File**: `nam20485/agent-instructions/ai_instruction_modules/ai-workflow-assignments/create-project-structure.md`
**Change Type**: Split Assignment into Multiple Assignments

**Current Issue:**
The create-project-structure assignment is too large and complex, covering:
- Package.json and dependencies
- TypeScript configuration
- Build tool setup
- React components
- Three.js integration
- Docker configuration
- CI/CD workflows
- Setup scripts

This makes the assignment difficult to test, debug, and complete in one session.

**Proposed Change:**
Split into 4 separate, focused assignments:

1. **create-project-foundation.md**
   - package.json and dependencies
   - TypeScript configuration
   - Build tool setup (Vite)
   - Basic file structure

2. **create-application-components.md**
   - React components
   - Component structure
   - Basic styling setup

3. **create-rendering-layer.md**
   - Three.js integration
   - React Three Fiber setup
   - Shape components

4. **create-infrastructure.md**
   - Docker configuration
   - CI/CD workflows
   - Setup scripts

**Rationale:**
- Each assignment is 30-60 minutes vs. 2-3 hours
- Easier to validate each step
- More reusable across projects
- Better failure isolation
- Clearer acceptance criteria per assignment

Reference: FB-023 from PROJECT_SETUP_DEBRIEF.md

**Impact:**
- Reduced cognitive load per assignment
- Better progress tracking
- Easier debugging if something fails
- More granular testing
- Estimated 25% time savings through better focus

**Implementation:**
1. Create 4 new assignment files
2. Extract relevant sections from original
3. Update dependencies between assignments
4. Update orchestrate-new-project workflow to use new assignments
5. Test with sample project
6. Archive old create-project-structure.md

**Testing:**
Run orchestrate-new-project workflow with new assignments and verify:
- All 4 assignments complete successfully
- Output matches original workflow
- Time per assignment is <60 minutes
- Failure in one assignment doesn't cascade
```

**Step 3: Save to Workflow Changes Document**
Save in current repo as `docs/FEEDBACK_WORKFLOW_CHANGES.md`

**Step 4: Create Issue in agent-instructions Repo**
```bash
gh issue create \
  --repo nam20485/agent-instructions \
  --title "[Workflow]: Split create-project-structure into 4 focused assignments" \
  --label "workflow-improvement,process-improvement" \
  --body "## Proposal
Split the create-project-structure assignment into 4 smaller, focused assignments.

## Background
