   5. Set up health checks and monitoring endpoints
   6. Configure for deployment to Google Cloud services

9. **CI/CD Pipeline Setup**
   1. Create GitHub Actions workflows for automated builds
   2. Set up automated testing on pull requests
   3. Configure Docker image building and pushing to GitHub registry
   4. Implement automated deployment to staging/production environments
   5. Set up code quality checks and static analysis
   6. Configure notifications and reporting

10. **Quality Assurance and Validation**
    1. Perform comprehensive testing of all application features
    2. Validate that all requirements from the template are met
    3. Ensure application follows established design principles
    4. Verify security best practices are implemented
