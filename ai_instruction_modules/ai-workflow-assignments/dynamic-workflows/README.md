# Dynamic Workflows (DSL)

The canonical documentation for the dynamic workflow DSL and real-mode plan now lives in the standalone orchestrator repository:

- Syntax (canonical): https://github.com/nam20485/ai-workflow-orchestrator/blob/main/docs/dynamic-workflow-syntax.md
- Real-mode plan: https://github.com/nam20485/ai-workflow-orchestrator/blob/main/docs/real-mode-plan.md

This folder contains workflow files consumed by the orchestrator. Prefer referencing the canonical docs above for the latest spec.
