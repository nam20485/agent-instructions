   - Highlight major milestones
   - Note any deliverables created

2. **Any issues encountered**:
   - Describe problems faced
   - Explain how they were resolved
   - Note any ongoing concerns

3. **Estimated time remaining**:

   - Any dependencies
   - Expected timeline

### Progress Tracking Tips

- **Update estimates**: Adjust time estimates as you learn more
- **Document issues**: Keep notes on problems and solutions
- **Celebrate milestones**: Acknowledge progress at each checkpoint
