# Before Starting Template

> **⚠️ DEPRECATED**: This standalone template file is deprecated and should no longer be embedded directly into assignment files.
> 
> **Migration Path**: This functionality has been consolidated into the event handler system:
> - **New Location**: `ai_instruction_modules/ai-workflow-assignments/event-handlers/pre-create-assignment.md`
> - **Trigger**: Automatically invoked by the workflow orchestrator before assignment execution
> - **Benefit**: Single source of truth eliminates duplication and maintenance burden
> 
> **For Assignment Authors**: Do NOT copy this content into new assignment files. The event handler system will automatically provide this functionality at the appropriate workflow lifecycle point.

## Legacy Content (for reference only)

~This template should be added to all workflow assignments after the "Assignment" section and before "Detailed Steps".~
This template should be added to all dynamic-workflows at the `pre-script-begins` event.
