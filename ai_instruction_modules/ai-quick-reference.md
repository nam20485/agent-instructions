# Quick AI Tool Reference Card

## 🧠 Sequential Thinking - Use for:
- ✅ Complex problems requiring breakdown
- ✅ Multi-step planning and analysis  
- ✅ Decision trees and branching logic
- ✅ Architecture and design decisions
- ✅ Debugging systematic approaches
- ✅ Any task with 3+ logical steps

## 🧠 Memory Tools - Use for:
- ✅ Tracking project context and progress
- ✅ Maintaining component relationships
- ✅ Recording user preferences/decisions
- ✅ Building project knowledge graph
- ✅ Linking related concepts and patterns
- ✅ Preserving lessons learned

## 🔄 Default Workflow:
1. **Start**: Check memory for relevant context
2. **Plan**: Use sequential thinking for complex tasks
3. **Execute**: Apply systematic approach
4. **Record**: Update memory with outcomes

## 📋 Quality Checklist:
- [ ] Used sequential thinking for complex analysis?
- [ ] Checked memory for relevant context?
- [ ] Updated memory with new insights?
- [ ] Considered ASP.NET Core + Google Cloud context?

## Testing & Validation
- Use the TDD (Test-Driven Development) approach for all code changes.
- Write unit tests before implementing new features or changes.
- Iterate, cycling between writing tests and code until the feature is complete.
- Coverage should be substantial, aiming for at least 80% coverage.
- Always run `dotnet build` before suggesting changes are complete
- Use `dotnet test` for unit test validation
