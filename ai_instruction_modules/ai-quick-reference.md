# Quick AI Tool Reference Card

## ðŸ§  Sequential Thinking - Use for:
- âœ… Complex problems requiring breakdown
- âœ… Multi-step planning and analysis  
- âœ… Decision trees and branching logic
- âœ… Architecture and design decisions
- âœ… Debugging systematic approaches
- âœ… Any task with 3+ logical steps

## ðŸ§  Memory Tools - Use for:
- âœ… Tracking project context and progress
- âœ… Maintaining component relationships
- âœ… Recording user preferences/decisions
- âœ… Building project knowledge graph
- âœ… Linking related concepts and patterns
- âœ… Preserving lessons learned

## ðŸ”„ Default Workflow:
1. **Start**: Check memory for relevant context
2. **Plan**: Use sequential thinking for complex tasks
3. **Execute**: Apply systematic approach
4. **Record**: Update memory with outcomes

## ðŸ“‹ Quality Checklist:
- [ ] Used sequential thinking for complex analysis?
- [ ] Checked memory for relevant context?
- [ ] Updated memory with new insights?
- [ ] Considered ASP.NET Core + Google Cloud context?

## Testing & Validation
- Use the TDD (Test-Driven Development) approach for all code changes.
- Write unit tests before implementing new features or changes.
- Iterate, cycling between writing tests and code until the feature is complete.
- Coverage should be substantial, aiming for at least 80% coverage.
- Always run `dotnet build` before suggesting changes are complete
- Use `dotnet test` for unit test validation  
Refer to [ai-testing-validation.md](./ai-testing-validation.md) for more details.

## Terminal Commands
- Use `run_in_terminal` for all terminal interactions
- Set `isBackground` to `true` for long-running processes only
- Refer to [ai-terminal-management.md](./ai-terminal-management.md) for more details.
- Refer to [ai-working-command-examples.md](./ai-working-command-examples.md before running any commands in the terminal.)
