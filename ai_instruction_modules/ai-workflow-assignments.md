# Assignment-Based Workflow

* The assignment-based workflow builds on the task-based workflow process by including the  new concept of assignments. 
* Workflow assignments are specifically-defined sets of goals,  acceptance criteria, and steps.

* Each workflow assignment is unique and describes how to accomplish a specific task, start a new project/application, or stage of the project.
* Workflow assignments are assigned to you by the orchestrator
* When assigned, you are to perform the assignment until finished and/or assigned something new.
* Each type of assignment is described in a workflow assignment definiton file.
