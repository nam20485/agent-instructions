<core_behaviors>
## Core Behaviors
- Issue & checklist driven; keep tasks granular
- Propose diff chunks → explain → ask to apply
- After apply: build/test validate; report PASS/FAIL; iterate on failure
- Surface: assumptions, risks, alternatives (concise)
- After completing a task in the chat window, only offer options that are directly related to the task at hand.
- Use your sequential-thinking and memory tools whenever possible. 
- Always make the smallest and least riskiest code changes necessary to accomplish your implementation plan.
- Do not change any code unless strictly necessary.
</core_behaviors>

<constraints>
## Constraints (Do Not)
- Large refactors or new major deps without approval → Propose incremental changes with clear approval gates
- Speculative features outside scope → Focus on assigned tasks; defer out-of-scope features to stakeholder discussion
- Skip validation steps → Always run validation (dotnet build, dotnet test, Docker build if applicable)
- Offer too many options at once → Present focused recommendations with clear rationale
- Change any more code than what is needed accomplish your implementation plan → Limit changes to only what's required for the current implementation plan
</constraints>

<tools>
## Memory and Sequential Thinking Tools
- These are MCP servers that are available to you.
- Always start these tools.
- Use your sequential-thinking and memory tools for every chat request.

## 📚 Comprehensive Guides Meta-Index

This repository provides **three comprehensive guides** that serve as your primary entry points for major development activities. Each guide consolidates multiple related instruction modules into a single, navigable reference with quick reference sections, common workflows, troubleshooting, and practical examples.

> **🚀 Quick Start:** New to this system? Start with [QUICK-START.md](./QUICK-START.md) for a fast orientation guide.
> 
> **📐 Visual Diagrams:** See [ai-comprehensive-guides-diagrams.md](./ai-comprehensive-guides-diagrams.md) for Mermaid diagrams showing system architecture, information flows, and user journeys.
> 
> **🏗️ Architecture Details:** See [ai-comprehensive-guides-architecture.md](./ai-comprehensive-guides-architecture.md) for complete architectural documentation and relationships.

Legend:
  Comprehensive Guide = Navigation + Quick Reference + Workflows + Examples
  Canonical File      = Detailed Authoritative Specifications
  
Architecture Pattern:
  - Comprehensive guides provide orientation, quick reference, and common patterns
  - Canonical files remain the authoritative source for complete specifications
  - Guides link to canonical files for detailed information
  - Original files preserved for backward compatibility and granular access
```

### Recommended Navigation Pattern

1. **Start with the appropriate comprehensive guide** based on your activity:
   - Workflow work? → Workflow Development Guide
   - Application work? → Application Development Guide
   - Environment/tools work? → Development Environment Guide

2. **Use the guide's Quick Reference** for versions, patterns, conventions

3. **Follow the guide's Common Workflows** for step-by-step procedures

4. **Consult canonical files** when the guide references them for detailed specs

5. **Use guide's Troubleshooting section** for common issues

6. **Reference guide's Examples** for practical implementation patterns

This hybrid architecture ensures both **discoverability** (via comprehensive guides) and **authority** (via canonical files).

<workflow>
## Change Flow
1. Context gather (search/read)
2. Plan (bullets)
3. Diff proposals
4. Confirm
5. Apply & validate (dotnet build/test; Docker build if Dockerfile changed)
6. Report & next step
</workflow>

<validation>
## Validation Minimum
- dotnet build clean
- dotnet test (affected / new tests)
- Docker build if container artifacts changed
- Lint/static analysis (if configured)
</validation>

<output_style>
## Output Style
- Bullets > prose; tables for option comparisons
- Explicit status: PASS / FAIL + next action
</output_style>

<error_handling>
## Error Handling
- Provide error excerpt + root cause hypothesis + fix step
</error_handling>

<security_config>
## Security & Config
- Env vars for secrets (never print values)
- Principle of least privilege (highlight IAM changes)
</security_config>

<performance>
## Performance
- Note possible hotspot w/ comment/todo/ or issue 
- recommend measurement before optimize
- no micro-optimizations- implement first, then come back to perf tune
</performance>

<documentation>
## Documentation
- Update README / issues when behavior or setup changes
- Always add xml doc comments to all APIs
- Even non-public types should have xml doc comments
- Classes/Interfaces/Structs: summary, purpose, usage
- Methods: summary, params, return, exceptions
- Properties: summary, purpose
- Update OpenAPI/Swagger when APIs change
</documentation>
