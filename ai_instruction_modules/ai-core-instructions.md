<hierarchy>
## Hierarchy (Conflict Resolution)
1. User explicit request
2. AI Instruction Modules:
   1. Executive Summary / Personal Preferences *(ai-executive-summary.md, ai-personal-preferences.md)*
   2. Tech stack guidelines (ASP.NET, Blazor, GCP, Docker) *(ai-instructions-aspnet-guidelines.md)*
   3. General design principles (SOLID, 12-Factor, DDD) *(ai-design-principles.md)*
   4. Workflow assignments (create app, perform task, review PR, etc.) *(ai-workflow-assignments.md)*
   5. Workflow processes (task-based, iterative guardrails) *(ai-task-based-workflow.md)*
</hierarchy>

<core_behaviors>
## Core Behaviors
- Issue & checklist driven; keep tasks granular
- Propose diff chunks → explain → ask to apply
- After apply: build/test validate; report PASS/FAIL; iterate on failure
- Surface: assumptions, risks, alternatives (concise)
- After completing a task in the chat window, only offer options that are directly related to the task at hand.
- Use your sequential-thinking and memory tools whenever possible. 
- Always make the smallest and least riskiest code changes necessary to accomplish your implementation plan.
- Do not change any code unless strictly necessary.
</core_behaviors>

<constraints>
## Constraints (Do Not)
- Large refactors or new major deps without approval
- Speculative features outside scope
- Skip validation steps
- Offer too many options at once.
- Change any more code than what is needed accomplish your implementation plan.
</constraints>

<tools>
## Memory and Sequential Thinking Tools
- These are MCP servers that are available to you.
- Always start these tools.
- Use your sequential-thinking and memory tools for every chat request.
</tools>

<workflow>
## Change Flow
1. Context gather (search/read)
2. Plan (bullets)
3. Diff proposals
4. Confirm
5. Apply & validate (dotnet build/test; Docker build if Dockerfile changed)
6. Report & next step
</workflow>

<validation>
## Validation Minimum
- dotnet build clean
- dotnet test (affected / new tests)
- Docker build if container artifacts changed
- Lint/static analysis (if configured)
</validation>

<output_style>
## Output Style
- Bullets > prose; tables for option comparisons
- Explicit status: PASS / FAIL + next action
</output_style>

<error_handling>
## Error Handling
- Provide error excerpt + root cause hypothesis + fix step
</error_handling>

<security_config>
## Security & Config
- Env vars for secrets (never print values)
- Principle of least privilege (highlight IAM changes)
</security_config>

<performance>
## Performance
- Note possible hotspot w/ comment/todo/ or issue 
- recommend measurement before optimize
- no micro-optimizations- implement first, then come back to perf tune
</performance>

<documentation>
## Documentation
- Update README / issues when behavior or setup changes
- Always add xml doc comments to all APIs
- Even non-public types should have xml doc comments
- Classes/Interfaces/Structs: summary, purpose, usage
- Methods: summary, params, return, exceptions
- Properties: summary, purpose
- Update OpenAPI/Swagger when APIs change
</documentation>

## More AI Instructions Modules

### Instruction Format Guide (**REQUIRED**: always reference!)

**Canonical reference for formatting all AI instruction files.**

This document defines the standards, conventions, and best practices for all instruction modules:
- XML semantic tag structure
- Markdown formatting rules
- File consolidation guidelines
- Multi-agent compatibility standards

**Read this when:**
- Creating new instruction modules
- Modifying existing instruction files
- Needing to understand instruction file structure
- Validating instruction file format

[ai-instructions-format.md](./ai-instructions-format.md)

### Required Modules (always read!)

Required modules are always active and so must always be read and followed.

#### Repository Summary

Contains high-level information about the repository, building, projects, and structure.

- [.ai-repository-summary.md](../ai-repo-summary.md)

- This file will not exist until after the project structure has been created
- Always create it after creating the project/solution structure
- Creating: [ai-create-repository-summary.md](./ai-create-repository-summary.md)

#### More Core Modules (**REQUIRED**: always read!)

Contains high-level information about development processes and guidelines
- [ai-executive-summary.md](./ai-executive-summary.md)
- [ai-personal-preferences.md](./ai-personal-preferences.md)
- [ai-quick-reference.md](./ai-quick-reference.md)
- [ai-workflow-config.md](./ai-workflow-config.md)
- [ai-local-environment.md](./ai-local-environment.md)

### Optional Modules (**OPTIONAL**: read based on current activity)

#### Terminal Management
Use this when working with the terminal
[ai-terminal-management.md](./ai-terminal-management.md)

#### Test and Validation
Use this when:
- writing or running tests
- validating builds
- validating Docker builds
- creating CI / CD pipelines

[ai-testing-validation.md](./ai-testing-validation.md)

#### Application Development

This includes:
- creating a new application from scratch
- adding new features to an existing application
- refactoring an existing application
- creating a new application or feature plan

#### Deployment
Use this as an example of how to configure a deployment environment.
- It uses a specific application called `AgentAsAService`, but you can use it as a template for your own application.
- [ai-deployment-environment.md](./ai-deployment-environment.md)

#### Workflows
These sections describe modules to use when you have been given an assignment or role.

##### Workflow Processes

- [ai-iterative-guardrails-workflow.md](./ai-workflow-processes/ai-iterative-guardrails-workflow.md)

Use this when performing actual development tasks:
  - writing code
  - implementing features
  - creating applications
  - creating DevOps pipelines
  - creating infrastructure as code (IaC)

Use this when performing planning or design tasks:
  - creating application plans
  - creating design docs
  - creating architecture diagrams
  - creating technical specs

### `.wip` Directory
The `.wip` directory contains files that are still in development and may not be fully functional or accurate. 

- They are included for reference and potential future use.
- No files in this directory need to be read.
